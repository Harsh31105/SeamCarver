How to interact with this Seam Carving:

- The simulation starts as paused. Use the space bar to unpause/pause the carving
- Press "v" to make the program only carve vertically
- Press "h" to make the program only carve horizontally
- Press "e" to see the energies of each pixel
    - The program will pause once you do this to give you a chance to see the energies,
      and you can press the space bar again to unpause it
- Press "w" to see the cumulative weight of each pixel
    - The program will pause once you do this to give you a chance to see the weights,
      and you can press the space bar again to unpause it
    - For a design decision, we chose to only make this method for vertical so that the display
      is representative of the image itself and resembles the shapes more
- Press "u" to enter undoing mode, where the previously removed seams are reinserted into the image
